This is a django application that will play tic tac toe with a player. It 
has a basic but colorful ajax gui and is designed to not lose.

This application was written with Python 2.6 and Django 1.2, but should work
for Python 2.5 or Python 2.7 as well. It uses a sqlite database and is not 
particularly taxing on system requires.

To try this application, please note that you'll need to make the files under
media/ available at your MEDIA_ROOT and/or modify templates/tictactoe/tictactoe.html to
find it somewhere else.

This was created for a potential interview as recommended by Apex Systems.

UPDATE: A superrational opponent who knew my strategy may beat me in this scenario:

Opp Corner, Me Center, Opp Opposite (rel them) corner, Me Side, Opp choose not to block and instead plays opposite corner (rel my last move) into this board position:

OMB
BMB
OBO

O = Opponent
M = Me
B = Black Space

If the algorithm doesn't look for a win (which it initially did not), it chooses the remaining corner. this causes the opponent to win.

Because of this, I have inserted a win if possible directive before block.

ENDUPDATE

I noticed that the requirements weren't to win the rather, rather not to lose the game. While draws would happen vs competent opponents each time, a perfect algorithm against an imperfect player stands at least a small chance of winning. Rather than attack the problem of recognizing forks, I broke the strategy of TicTacToe into a series of opening moves. They follow below:

If Opponent plays first in a Corner, play Center. Then:

    (a) If the opponent plays in the opposite (relative them) corner, play a side to force blocking into a draw.
    (b) If the opponent plays an adjacent side or corner, you must block.
    (c) If the opponent plays a non-adjacent side, you play an adjacent (relative their corner) corner.

If Opponent plays first in the side, play Center. Then choose the nearest corner relative to their move or any corner if they take the opponent side.

If Opponent plays first in Center, play Corners until you begin blocking. 

If you play first play center, then a non-diagonal corner (relative them). Blocking begins.

If any time after these series of openings you need a move, try block, then take any corner, then take any free space.

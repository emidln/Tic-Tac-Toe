# * per-item getters and setters should work and automatically translate ints to strings
# * slicing works, in particular self[:] is used probably far more than it should be to 
#   get a list of ints
# * str() is useful for console debugging (it breaks on rows)
# * as_t is slightly nonstandard. It would have led to slightly more code duplication if I had 
#   written it to be like the standard django as_t and leave off the <table></table>. The only
#   real side effect of doing this is that you can't customize the header info or add in extra
#   data without some work. 
# * behind the scenes, Board keeps state in squares_l, which is size 9 CharField
# * conversions are handled as needed where it makes sense
# * some exceptions are passed transparently. This is purposeful since these exceptions represent 
#   game events like winning, losing or illegal/undefined actions that the user should know about

This is a django application that will play tic tac toe with a player. It 
has a basic but colorful ajax gui and is designed to not lose.

This application was updated to run against Python 2.7 and Django 1.6.

Dependencies are included in pip-requirements.txt. To use (possibly in a virtualenv),

run:

mkvirtualenv tictactoe
workon tictactoe
pip install -r pip-requirements.txt

Follow that with setting up the django environment:

python manage.py test
python manage.py syncdb --noinput
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py runserver

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/tictactoe/

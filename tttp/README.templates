The templates consist of a local base which extends a site base as well as an xml data file and the main page. None of them are paritcularly fancy, although tictactoe.html does require title, extrahead, and content blocks to be in your base. JQuery is loaded via Google CDN and Taconite is loaded locally. Taconite is included with this distribution in media/ because it makes ajax less of a hassle. If you're running under the dev server, you'll probably want to read http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/howto/static-files/

Of potential note is the isomorphic view that taconite provides. A completely rendered page is loaded on first view and yet the page is fully dynamic with duplicating tons of code. In a full system, a class-based view would be created such that new views would only require subclassing the CBV and providing a view_logic that returns a dictionary and configuring a template prefix. The only real concession that is made is that pieces of code that need be dynamic should be written into partial includes files, but this is a concession that you already need to make (or duplicate the logic between frontend and backend templating systems).
